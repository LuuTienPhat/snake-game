# Snake Game

A simple game, and also a childhood game for me :), i have got 20,000 points on my Nokia 1280 xD.

## Demo
https://luutienphat.github.io/snake-game/

## I used:
  * HTML, CSS, Javascript
  * IDE: Visual Studio Code.

## UI
  - I made two type of UI, for screen below 800px or have touch screen, the app will automatically render Phone UI, else it will show Desktop UI.
  - For the phone UI, i tried to fit app on single page, so when we play the game, it wouldn't slide up and down then touched the screen.
